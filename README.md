## About

I have spent the last month focusing on learning more about Svelte and NextJs. I wanted to create a simple blog using both the following technologies.

- NextJs
- Markdown for content hosted in a git repo
- Remark for parsing markdown
- Tailwind for styling
- Node for backend server functions such as fetching content etc..

Note that much of this content is from DaveGray's fantastic NextJS course on Youtube. I have added some of my own content and code to tweak some of the functionality. Additionally, the styling is mostly from Shadcn's blog page. I loved the minimal theme and I am a terrible UI designer. I wanted to replicate as much of that content as possible as it looks amazing

## Future plans

Image rendering, search, tag clouds, maybe comment functionality.
